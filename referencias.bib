   abstract = {Predicting the structures of protein-protein complexes is a difficult problem owing to the topographical and thermodynamic complexity of these structures. Past efforts in this area have focussed on fitting the interacting proteins together using rigid body searches, usually with the conformations of the proteins as they occur in crystal structure complexes. Here we present work which uses a rigid body docking method to generate the structures of three known protein complexes, using both the bound and unbound conformations of the interacting molecules. In all cases we can regenerate the geometry of the crystal complexes to high accuracy. We also are able to find geometries that do not resemble the crystal structure but nevertheless are surprisingly reasonable both mechanistically and by some simple physical criteria. In contrast to previous work in this area, we find that simple methods for evaluating the complementarity at the protein-protein interface cannot distinguish between the configurations that resemble the crystal structure complex and those that do not. Methods that could not distinguish between such similar and dissimilar configurations include surface area burial, solvation free energy, packing and mechanism-based filtering. Evaluations of the total interaction energy and the electrostatic interaction energy of the complexes were somewhat better. Of the techniques that we tried, energy minimization distinguished most clearly between the "true" and "false" positives, though even here the energy differences were surprisingly small. We found the lowest total interaction energy from amongst all of the putative complexes generated by docking was always within 5 Å root-mean-square of the crystallographic structure. There were, however, several putative complexes that were very dissimilar to the crystallographic structure but had energies that were close to that of the low energy structure. The magnitude of the error in energy calculations has not been established in macromolecular systems, and thus the reliability of the small differences in energy remains to be determined. The ability of this docking method to regenerate the crystallographic configurations of the interacting proteins using their unbound conformations suggests that it will be a useful tool in predicting the structures of unsolved complexes. © 1991.},

@article{Ritchie2008,
   abstract = {This article gives an overview of recent progress in protein-protein docking and it identifies several directions for future research. Recent results from the CAPRI blind docking experiments show that docking algorithms are steadily improving in both reliability and accuracy. Current docking algorithms employ a range of efficient search and scoring strategies, including e.g. fast Fourier transform correlations, geometric hashing, and Monte Carlo techniques. These approaches can often produce a relatively small list of up to a few thousand orientations, amongst which a near-native binding mode is often observed. However, despite the use of improved scoring functions which typically include models of desolvation, hydrophobicity, and electrostatics, current algorithms still have difficulty in identifying the correct solution from the list of false positives, or decoys. Nonetheless, significant progress is being made through better use of bioinformatics, biochemical, and biophysical information such as e.g. sequence conservation analysis, protein interaction databases, alanine scanning, and NMR residual dipolar coupling restraints to help identify key binding residues. Promising new approaches to incorporate models of protein flexibility during docking are being developed, including the use of molecular dynamics snapshots, rotameric and off-rotamer searches, internal coordinate mechanics, and principal component analysis based techniques. Some investigators now use explicit solvent models in their docking protocols. Many of these approaches can be computationally intensive, although new silicon chip technologies such as programmable graphics processor units are beginning to offer competitive alternatives to conventional high performance computer systems. As cryo-EM techniques improve apace, docking NMR and X-ray protein structures into low resolution EM density maps is helping to bridge the resolution gap between these complementary techniques. The use of symmetry and fragment assembly constraints are also helping to make possible docking-based predictions of large multimeric protein complexes. In the near future, the closer integration of docking algorithms with protein interface prediction software, structural databases, and sequence analysis techniques should help produce better predictions of protein interaction networks and more accurate structural models of the fundamental molecular interactions within the cell.},

@article{Janin2003,
   abstract = {CAPRI is a communitywide experiment to assess the capacity of protein-docking methods to predict protein-protein interactions. Nine-teen groups participated in rounds 1 and 2 of CAPRI and submitted blind structure predictions for seven protein-protein complexes based on the known structure of the component proteins. The predictions were compared to the unpublished X-ray structures of the complexes. We describe here the motivations for launching CAPRI, the rules that we applied to select targets and run the experiment, and some conclusions that can already be drawn. The results stress the need for new scoring functions and for methods handling the conformation changes that were observed in some of the target systems. CAPRI has already been a powerful drive for the community of computational biologists who development docking algorithms. We hope that this issue of Proteins will also be of interest to the community of structural biologists, which we call upon to provide new targets for future rounds of CAPRI, and to all molecular biologists who view protein-protein recognition as an essential process. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {New molecular modeling approaches, driven by rapidly improving computational platforms, have allowed many success stories for the use of computer-assisted drug design in the discovery of new mechanism-or structure-based drugs. In this overview, we highlight three aspects of the use of molecular docking. First, we discuss the combination of molecular and quantum mechanics to investigate an unusual enzymatic mechanism of a flavoprotein. Second, we present recent advances in anti-infectious agents' synthesis driven by structural insights. At the end, we focus on larger biological complexes made by protein-protein interactions and discuss their relevance in drug design. This review provides information on how these large systems, even in the presence of the solvent, can be investigated with the outlook of drug discovery.},
